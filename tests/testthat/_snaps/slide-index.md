# .before/.after - generated endpoints must be in weakly ascending order

    Endpoints generated by `.before` must be in ascending order.
    i They are not ascending at locations: 2.

---

    Endpoints generated by `.after` must be in ascending order.
    i They are not ascending at locations: 2.

# .before/.after - generated endpoints must maintain .before <= .after ordering

    In the ranges generated by `.before` and `.after`, the start of the range is after the end of the range at location(s): 1, 2.

    In the ranges generated by `.before` and `.after`, the start of the range is after the end of the range at location(s): 1, 2.

# .before/.after - generated endpoints can't be NA

    Endpoints generated by `.before` cannot be `NA`.
    i They are `NA` at locations: 1, 2.

    Endpoints generated by `.after` cannot be `NA`.
    i They are `NA` at locations: 1, 2.

# .before/.after - generated endpoints shouldn't rely on original `.i` length

    Endpoints generated by `.before` have an incorrect size.
    i They must have size 1, not 2.

---

    Endpoints generated by `.after` have an incorrect size.
    i They must have size 1, not 2.
